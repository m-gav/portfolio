        <p>I am a front end web developer and designer interested in minimal and brutalist design. After finishing a degree in music production, I decided to change direction and pursue web development fuelled by the creative energy I acquired through my musical endeavors. My other interests include producing electronic music, DJing, watching films, visiting art galleries, and exploring the outdoors.</p>
